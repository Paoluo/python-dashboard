# Dashboard in Python üêç

This project was created in Python. The dashboard was built in Jupyter Notebook. The data is fetched online from:
- Yahoo Finance service,
- Binance REST API,
- Open Meteo REST API.

The website and dashboard are served with <a href="https://github.com/mljar/mercuruy" target="_blank">Mercury</a> framework. It turns Jupyter Notebook to web application. It adds interactive widgets to notbook based on the YAML header (from the first raw cell in the notebook). 

The code for this website: [github.com/pplonski/python-dashboard](https://github.com/pplonski/python-dashboard).

The dashboard is available online at: [python-dashboard.mljar.com](https://python-dashboard.mljar.com).
